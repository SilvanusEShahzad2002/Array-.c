**Student Marks Array in C
**
This program demonstrates how to use an array in C to store and print marks of multiple students. It first asks the user to enter the marks of 5 students for the English subject, stores them in an array, and then displays the entered marks for each student.

**How It Works
**
An integer array std[5] is created to store 5 students' marks.

A for loop is used to take input from the user for each student.

Another for loop is used to print all the marks entered.
